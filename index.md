# Dark mAtteR iNvesigator (DARN) <br/> understanding the unknown unknowns 

This site may be considered as supplementary material for the 
DARN publication, including all the Krona plots discussed. 


A series of samples were investigated to establish the presence of bacterial and non-bacterial 
dark matter on COI data. 
To this end, marine, estuarine and samples from lakes were gathered. 
In the case of marine samples, both bulk and eDNA samples were collected. 

In the sections to follow, we present all the Krona plots of each case in a single plot, meaning that for 
all the different tests of a single case, all Kronas are embeded on a single plot and you may compare them 
by clicking on the up-left box where are listed. 


## Marine samples 

Both bulk and eDNA marine samples were analysed. 
For a thorough description of the samples you may see the DARN manuscript 
and the corresponding supplementary files.


### Irish samples - Laura's data

Sequences coming from Irish 

Long sequences, long sequences that had a taxonomic hit, short sequences and short sequences that had a taxonomic hit

### Tropical samples - Sanni's data


Reef and mangrove data from Honduras and Kenya.

### Bulk samples (Obst et al. 2020)

The following Krona plots are coming from samples that 

* ARMS sample on EtOH using pre clustered sequences 
* ARMS sample on EtOH using ASVs after running Swarm v2 with *d*=2
* ARMS sample on EtOH using ASVs after running Swarm v2 with *d*=10 
* ARMS sample on DMSO using pre clustered sequences 
* ARMS sample on DMSO using ASVs after running Swarm v2 with *d*=2
* ARMS sample on DMSO using ASVs after running Swarm v2 with *d*=10  
* Sediment sample using pre clustered sequences
* Sediment sample using ASVs after running Swarm v2 with *d*=2
* Sediment sample using ASVs after running Swarm v2 with *d*=10

## Freshwater samples 


### Bista et al. (2017)

3 samples from the study of Bista et al. (2017) were used. 
2 of them of 235bp long and one of 658bp. 
The sequences were analyzed through PEMA. 
`darn` was then implemented both before and after the ASVs inference .

<!-- ## Estuarine samples (Bellisario et al. 2021)

From the Bellisario et al. 2021 preprint we got 2 samples, 1 from the Vigo sample site, a V-shaped estuarine basin classified as a fjord, 
and a second one from RÃ­a de Aveiro, a coastal lagoon connected directly to the ocean and dominated mainly by tidal forces.

### Norway lakes samples

Here are the first two of them. 

We know only that are coming from some vikings for the time being. We add more once we know! :)
